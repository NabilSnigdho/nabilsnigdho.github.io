RUET Cover Page Generator is a web app that helps RUET students quickly create cover pages for assignments and lab reports. It comes with smart autocompletion for RUET-specific info like department, course, and teacher names.

Key Features:

- **Smart Autocompletion**: Auto-fills common fields like department, session, course code, and teacher names with RUET-specific presets to save time and reduce errors.

- **High-Quality PDF Generation**: Uses ReactPDF (based on pdfkit) under the hood to render clean, print-ready cover pages.

- **Live PDF Preview**: See changes in real-time using react-pdf (pdfjs) for instant visual feedback.

- **Customizable Layouts**: Maintain the official format while allowing personalization like watermark, borders, arrangement.

No need to format manuallyâ€”just fill in, preview, and download.
