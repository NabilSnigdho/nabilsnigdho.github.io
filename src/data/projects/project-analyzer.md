Simple tool I made for an assignment of Engineering Economics course. It compares projects based on their NPV, and Incremental Analysis.

I uses simple old react-to-print library to print the results. I'm very surprised there isn't that much of a react wrappers for katex or MathJax, thanks to [harunurhan](https://github.com/harunurhan) for maintaining [react-latex-next](https://github.com/harunurhan/react-latex-next).
